# Code Challenge
### 👾 Pokémon Team Builder
Implement in [React](https://pt-br.reactjs.org) a web page, which contains 2 tabs ("Create a new team" and "Team") as defined in the following mockup.

![Initial State](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31046437/132687724-c7302b72-3fa0-4283-8a98-2a6cf2fd4367.png) ![Teams](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31046437/132687773-ac50269e-7994-4aba-958e-d3e930cc5e1c.png)

the challenge can be done with pure React (plus [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org), if you have familiarity) or with some other React-based framework like [NextJs](https://nextjs.org), styling with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) if you want to, maintaining a global state with Context API. In addition you will need a database to store the data and a simple backend to consume it and it was meant to be done in 3 days.

### 📱 App
the idea of the App is to create a Pokémon team builder, where you must choose 6 monsters to compose your team and view the teams already created.

### 🔑 Key points
 - Put proper comments in code, so that we can understand the function usage etc..
 - Componentization and interactions taking in to consideration the atomic design principles.
 - Api consuming and iteration with its data into the UI.
 - State management between pages (preferably with Context API, but you can try Redux as well)
